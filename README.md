These are the official lab instructions for the k-space lab for the Stockholm University course Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FK8032). 

If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks or if you don't have Python set up on your own computer, you can access the lab through MyBinder by clicking below

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fyrdahl/kspace-lab/master?filepath=kspacelab.ipynb)

If you prefer to work in your own environment, download the ``*.ipynb`` or the plain ``*.py`` file. Don't forget ``data.h5``.

Lab instructions are available in text form, either as [HTML](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fyrdahl/kspace-lab/blob/master/kspacelab.html) or [PDF](kspacelab.pdf)!
