    "A few tips for numpy:\n",
    "* Numpy uses zero-based indexing, e.g. ``my_nparray[0]`` is the first element.\n",
    "* Arrays can be sliced using the ``[start:stop:step]`` notation, e.g. ``my_nparray[::2]`` for every second element or ``my_nparray[0:20]`` for the 20 first elements.\n",
    "* Before modifying a variable, it is a good idea to make a copy, e.g. ``my_kspace = kspace_res512_FOV24.copy()``, otherwise you might end up with unwanted results.\n",
    "* If you want to initialize a zero matrix with ``np.zeros``, you need to specify that it's a complex datatype using ``dtype=np.complex64``\n",
    "* The command ``np.log`` may give undesired results for arrays containing zeros. You can use ``np.log(x+1)`` for those instances.\n",
    "* ``ij`` or ``0+ij`` can be used to represent complex numbers. ``np.pi`` can be used for pi.\n",
    "* In numpy convention, the first dimension (axis=0) corresponds to rows and the second dimension (axis=1) corresponds to columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few tips for matplotlib:\n",
    "* Use ``plt.imshow`` to display images, and use the option ``cmap='gray'`` to display them in black and white.\n",
    "* When the question calls for multiple plots, you can either use ``plt.figure()`` to create multiple plots or use ``fig, axes = plt.subplots(2,2)`` to create a 2 by 2 grid.\n",
    "* If your figures appear too small, you can use ``figsize=(20,20)`` to make the plotting area larger, e.g. ``plt.figure(figsize=(20,20))`` or ``fig, axes = plt.subplots(2,2, figsize=(20,20))``\n",
